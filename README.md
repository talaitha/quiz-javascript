Hello all, 

Just wanted to write a quick bit before I submitted to you. 

First off, I want to say that this was an interesting quiz / problem, certainly unlike anything I've been tested with before. Secondly, I want to be up front with you and say that encryption / decryption or even data scrambling isn't my forte'. I'd love to know more about it, but I was only really able to figure out the solution here by googling quite a bit. I'm very much a front end developer.. I love javascript, figuring out performant functions and the like, but I do spend a lot of time creating pixel perfect sites, working with designers, etc.., just so you know where my background lies. 

That said, I was able to see your message by showing only hidden spans. I then did a quick and dirty random character gen and topped it off with a toggle button. 

Hope that's what you were looking for. 

Thanks!

- Scott
